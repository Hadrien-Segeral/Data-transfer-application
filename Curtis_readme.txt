Architecture :
We assume the architecture is (on desktop) :
./ServerFiles
./server.exe
./ClientFiles
./client.exe

Usage :
Run the client first with :
$ ./server.exe
And then run the client :
$ ./client.exe

Note :

If your system has to change the execution right, use :
$ chmod +x server.exe
$ chmod +x client.exe
